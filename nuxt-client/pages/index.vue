                        This project serves as a boilerplate for building a robust REST API with Laravel
                        and a frontend application with Nuxt.js. It includes essential features for user management,
                        such as listing users, updating profile details, and handling account actions for logged-in
                        users.
                        Additionally, it provides built-in email verification, password reset, and email update
                        functionalities.

                        and manage account settings with ease. All features are secured with authentication and leverage
